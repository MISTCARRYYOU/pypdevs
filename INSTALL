==============================================================================
     General guidelines:
==============================================================================
This project structure mostly follows the guidelines presented at
http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/
With the difference that CMake is used.

==============================================================================
     Directory layout:
==============================================================================
The following directories are present at the root level:
  - docs: contains all documentation source code, to be parsed by Sphinx.
  - examples: contains several examples of a traffic light in different 
    formalisms and with different simulation options.
  - performance: contains 2 small performance benchmarks, one for a specific
    DEVStone setup and another for firespread.
  - pypdevs: the source code.
  - test: contains the tests.

Several files are present here too:
  - features.txt: a list of most features that are supported, together with
    a list of features that should not be ported to C++.
  - INSTALL: this file.
  - install_mpi4py.sh: a script to install MPICH3 and mpi4py.
  - install_sphinx.sh: a script to install Sphinx.
  - LICENSE: the used copyright license.
  - NOTICE: the copyright notice that is present in every file.
  - notes.txt: release notes.
  - README.md: general introduction about the project.
  - setup.py.in: the Python setuptools template to be used by CMake.

==============================================================================
     Building the documentation:
==============================================================================
The most extensive resource is the enclosed documentation. This can be build
by executing the following commands:
  
   ./install_sphinx.sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

The documentation can now be found under build/docs/html/index.html
Further installation guidelines and examples are presented there.
